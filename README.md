## Detailed Description

This script is designed to facilitate the transcription of YouTube videos into text format. It eliminates the need for time-consuming manual transcription by automating the process through a series of well-defined steps. The user-friendly interface allows users to input a YouTube video URL, which is then processed to extract the audio, convert it into text, and save the transcription as a text file. This efficient and convenient solution is ideal for those who require quick and accurate transcriptions for various purposes, such as research, content creation, or accessibility.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly:** Designed for ease of use, the script prompts users to enter a YouTube video URL, minimizing the need for complicated setup processes.
- **Efficient Audio Extraction:** The script utilizes the `pytube` library to effectively filter and download the audio stream from the specified YouTube video.
- **High-Quality Transcription:** The `whisper` library, a powerful speech-to-text tool, is employed to accurately transcribe the downloaded audio into text.
- **Convenient Output:** The transcription is saved as a text file in the same directory as the script, ensuring easy access and sharing capabilities.
